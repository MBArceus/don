Some of the channels in DR_EN are role-restricted to prevent the channel listing from getting too long or to allow members to "opt-in" to certain discussions. This command gives you one of those roles on demand.
Usage is as follows: `{PREFIX}addrole [name of role]`.
To see the list of open roles, use the `{PREFIX}openroles` command.

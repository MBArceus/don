Some of the channels in DR_EN are role-restricted to prevent the channel listing from getting too long or to allow members to "opt-in" to certain discussions. Use this command if you have one of these roles and want to "opt-out".
Usage is as follows: `{PREFIX}removerole [name of role]`.
To see the list of open roles, use the `{PREFIX}openroles` command.
